A health API typically refers to an interface provided by a service, application,
or system that offers endpoints for checking the health and status of that service.
This API is commonly used to perform health checks, monitor system status, and
verify if the service is running properly.

The purpose of a health API is to expose endpoints that can be queried to determine
the operational status of a service. These endpoints might return information indicating
whether the service is reachable, functioning correctly, and whether its dependencies
(such as databases, external services, etc.) are also healthy.

In Express.js, res.status(404) is a method used to set the HTTP status code of the
response to 404, which stands for "Not Found". It's commonly used to indicate to the
client (such as a web browser or an API consumer) that the requested resource or
route was not found on the server. Whenever we enter a route which is not
present then this middleware will be called .

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
fullname: String,
email: { type: String, unique: true },
password: String,
age: Number,
gender: String,
mobile: String
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

We can write userSchema like this also

The line const router = express.Router(); creates a new instance of an Express router.

In Express.js, routers are middleware that allow you to group route handlers and related functionality together. They enable you to define sets of routes separately and then combine them into your main application.

The express.Router() function returns an object which can be used to define route handlers for different HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) on a specified URL path.

const now = new Date(); // Create a new Date object with the current date and time

const currentYear = now.getFullYear(); // Get the current year (e.g., 2023)
const currentMonth = now.getMonth() + 1; // Get the current month (0-11, add 1 to get the actual month)
const currentDay = now.getDate(); // Get the current day of the month (1-31)
const currentHour = now.getHours(); // Get the current hour (0-23)
const currentMinute = now.getMinutes(); // Get the current minute (0-59)
const currentSecond = now.getSeconds(); // Get the current second (0-59)

const endDate = new Date(startDate.getTime() + 7 _ 24 _ 60 _ 60 _ 1000); ( underscore => multiply or star)

1. new Date() creates a Date object representing the current date and time.
2. startDate.getTime() gets the timestamp in milliseconds for the startDate.
3. 7 _ 24 _ 60 _ 60 _ 1000 calculates 7 days in milliseconds (24 hours/day _ 60 minutes/hour _ 60 seconds/minute \_ 1000 milliseconds/second).
4. startDate.getTime() + 7 _ 24 _ 60 _ 60 _ 1000 adds 7 days (in milliseconds) to the startDate timestamp.
5. new Date(...) constructs a new Date object using the modified timestamp, representing the end date.

const weeklist = user.activeWeekLists.find(
(weekList) => weekList.\_id.toString() === weeklistId
);

This code utilizes the Array.prototype.find() method in JavaScript. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

user.activeWeekLists.find():

user.activeWeekLists refers to an array (presumably an array of weeklist objects) within the user object.
.find() is an array method in JavaScript that searches for the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.
(weekList) => weekList.\_id.toString() === weeklistId:

This part is an arrow function used as the testing function for find().
(weekList) is the parameter representing each element (weeklist object) in the array during iteration.
weekList.\_id.toString() retrieves the \_id property of each weeklist object and converts it to a string. (The assumption here is that \_id is an ObjectId or a unique identifier in your MongoDB setup.)
=== weeklistId compares this string representation of the \_id with the provided weeklistId. It checks for equality.
const weeklist = ...:

If find() finds an element in the user.activeWeekLists array where the \_id matches the given weeklistId, it assigns that specific weeklist object to the variable weeklist.
If no matching element is found, weeklist will be undefined.

allUsers.forEach((user) => {
const userWeeklists = user.weekLists.map((weeklist) => {
const currentDate = new Date();
const endDate = new Date(weeklist.endDate);

        const timeLeft = endDate.getTime() - currentDate.getTime();

        const daysLeft = Math.ceil(timeLeft / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
        const hoursLeft = Math.floor(
          (timeLeft % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60)
        );
        const minutesLeft = Math.floor(
          (timeLeft % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60)
        );
        const secondsLeft = Math.floor((timeLeft % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);

        const formattedTime = `${daysLeft}d:${hoursLeft}h:${minutesLeft}m:${secondsLeft}s`;

        return {
          ...weeklist.toObject(),
          timeLeft: formattedTime,
          createdBy: user.fullName,
          userId: user._id,
        };
      });

      allWeeklists = allWeeklists.concat(userWeeklists);
    });

Explanation : For each user outer loop is running , for particular user weeklists inner loop is running.
Weeklist is a mongoose document so when sending that to userWeekLists , we are converting it to object.
Then after iterating all weeklists of a user we are storing his/her weeklists in allWeeklists array.
Inner loop : return -> to userWeekLists
Outer loop : allWeekLists -> add userWeekl
